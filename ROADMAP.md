# Hub's Development Roadmap
## Overview
We are introducing this public development roadmap to help our users and contributors understand the project's direction. For a longer discussion, please refer to this [document](https://www.notion.so/Hub-Roadmap-24854a6648bb488e9063681890f8c890).

### Target audience
Anyone interested in Hub. This includes developers and end users

## Contributing to the roadmap
### Add a new project for consideration
Anyone from the community can add a new proposed project to the roadmap:
> 1. By adding a [new issue](https://github.com/activeloopai/Hub/issues) in the repo
> 1. Add the issue to the [project board](https://github.com/activeloopai/Hub/projects/10)
 
### Prioritization
When a new project is created, it will be placed in the **Discussion** column, where it receives feedback from the community and core maintainers (@AbhinavTuli, @davidbuniat, @edogrigqv2, @kristinagrig06, @haiyangdeperci, @mynameisvinn, @mikayelh).

For a project to happen (in other words, get "prioritized" in the roadmap), three things need to be in place:

> 1. The scope is clear enough to understand the functional benefits and user impact on a high level
> 1. A community member is willing to dedicate the effort and resources to make the project happen
> 1. A core maintainer is willing to sponsor the project - that is, define scope, write corresponding unit tests, and review PR.

When these conditions are met, the card is moved to the **Committed** column. The subsequent **In Development** and **Done** columns indicate the development status.
