# Hub Public Roadmap
## Overview
We are introducing this public roadmap to help our users and contributors understand the project's direction. 

### Target audience
Anyone interested in Hub. This includes developers and end users.

## Contributing to the roadmap
### Add a new project for consideration
Anyone from the community can add a new proposed project to the roadmap:
> 1. By adding a new issue in the repo
> 1. Add the issue to the [project board](https://github.com/activeloopai/Hub/projects/10)
 
### Prioritization
When a new project is created, it will be placed in the **Inbox** column. As the project received feedback, the scope is defined and clarified it will be in the **Discussion** column.

For a project to happen (get "prioritized" in the roadmap), two things need to be in place:

> 1. The scope is clear enough to understand the functional benefits and user impact on a high level
> 1. A community member is willing to dedicate the effort and resources to make the project happen

When these conditions are met, the card is moved to the **Committed** column. The subsequent **In Development** and **Done** columns indicate the development status.
